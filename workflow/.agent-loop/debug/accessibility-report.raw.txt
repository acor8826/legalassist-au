Accessibility Report for `DocumentViewerModal` Implementation

## Issues and Fixes

1. **Lack of Focus Management**:
   - **Issue**: The modal does not have a proper focus management strategy, which can make it difficult for users to navigate the content using a keyboard.
   - **Fix**: Implement a focus management strategy to ensure that the first focusable element (e.g., the "Add to Chat" button) receives focus when the modal is opened, and the focus is restored to the previously focused element when the modal is closed.

   ```tsx
   useEffect(() => {
     if (isFocused && addToChatButtonRef.current) {
       addToChatButtonRef.current.focus();
     }
   }, [isFocused]);
   ```

2. **Insufficient ARIA Labeling**:
   - **Issue**: The ARIA labels provided for the "Add to Chat" button are not comprehensive enough to convey the current state of the operation to screen reader users.
   - **Fix**: Enhance the ARIA labeling to provide more detailed information about the current state of the operation, such as whether the document is being added or has been successfully added.

   ```tsx
   <button
     aria-live={status === 'loading' ? 'assertive' : 'polite'}
     aria-label={
       status === 'idle'
         ? 'Add document to chat'
         : status === 'loading'
         ? 'Adding document to chat'
         : status === 'success'
         ? 'Document added to chat'
         : 'Failed to add document to chat'
     }
   >
     {/* ... */}
   </button>
   ```

3. **Lack of Keyboard Trap Handling**:
   - **Issue**: The modal does not have a mechanism to trap the keyboard focus within the modal, which can cause issues for users navigating with a keyboard.
   - **Fix**: Implement a keyboard trap to ensure that the focus is confined within the modal, and provide a way for users to close the modal using the keyboard.

   ```tsx
   const handleKeyDown = useCallback(
     (event: React.KeyboardEvent<HTMLDivElement>) => {
       if (event.key === 'Escape') {
         onClose();
       } else if (event.key === 'Enter' || event.key === ' ') {
         handleAddToChat();
       } else if (event.key === 'Tab') {
         const focusableElements = Array.from(
           document.querySelectorAll(
             'a[href], button, textarea, input, select, [tabindex]:not([tabindex="-1"])'
           )
         );
         const firstFocusableElement = focusableElements[0];
         const lastFocusableElement = focusableElements[focusableElements.length - 1];

         if (event.shiftKey) {
           if (document.activeElement === firstFocusableElement) {
             lastFocusableElement.focus();
             event.preventDefault();
           }
         } else {
           if (document.activeElement === lastFocusableElement) {
             firstFocusableElement.focus();
             event.preventDefault();
           }
         }
       }
     },
     [onClose, handleAddToChat]
   );
   ```

4. **Lack of Contrast Ratio Compliance**:
   - **Issue**: The color contrast ratio between the text and background colors in the modal may not meet the WCAG 2.1 AA requirements, which can make the content difficult to read for users with visual impairments.
   - **Fix**: Ensure that the color contrast ratio between the text and background colors meets the WCAG 2.1 AA requirements (minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text).

   ```tsx
   <div className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-lg p-8 w-full max-w-md">
     {/* ... */}
   </div>
   ```

## Test Checklist

1. [ ] Verify that the first focusable element (the "Add to Chat" button) receives focus when the modal is opened.
2. [ ] Ensure that the focus is restored to the previously focused element when the modal is closed.
3. [ ] Confirm that the ARIA labels for the "Add to Chat" button accurately reflect the current state of the operation.
4. [ ] Verify that the keyboard focus is trapped within the modal, and users can close the modal using the "Esc" key.
5. [ ] Ensure that the color contrast ratio between the text and background colors meets the WCAG 2.1 AA requirements.
6. [ ] Test the modal's functionality using a screen reader to ensure that all content and interactions are accessible.
7. [ ] Verify that the modal's behavior and accessibility features work as expected across different browsers and devices.
