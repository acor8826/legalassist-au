Here's a markdown report with the analysis and optimization suggestions for the provided implementation:

## Performance Analysis and Optimization Report

### Issues Found

1. **Potential Memory Leaks**: The `DocumentViewerModal` component uses the `useEffect` hook to focus the "Add to Chat" button when the component is focused. However, the cleanup function returned by the `useEffect` hook is not implemented, which could lead to memory leaks if the component is unmounted while it's still focused.

2. **Unnecessary Re-renders**: The `DocumentViewerModal` component re-renders whenever the `status` or `errorMessage` state changes, even if the props (`document` and `onClose`) haven't changed. This could lead to unnecessary re-renders, especially if the component is complex or has a large number of child components.

3. **Potential Performance Impact of Toasts**: The `SuccessToast` and `ErrorToast` components are rendered directly within the `DocumentViewerModal` component. Depending on the implementation and the number of toasts displayed, this could have a negative impact on the overall performance of the modal.

### Code Changes

1. **Implement Cleanup Function in `useEffect`**:
   ```tsx
   useEffect(() => {
     if (isFocused && addToChatButtonRef.current) {
       addToChatButtonRef.current.focus();
     }

     return () => {
       // Add cleanup function to remove event listeners or cancel timers, if necessary
     };
   }, [isFocused]);
   ```

2. **Memoize the `DocumentViewerModal` Component**:
   ```tsx
   const MemoizedDocumentViewerModal = React.memo(DocumentViewerModal, (prevProps, nextProps) => {
     return prevProps.document.id === nextProps.document.id && prevProps.onClose === nextProps.onClose;
   });
   ```

3. **Extract Toasts to a Separate Component**:
   ```tsx
   // ToastContainer.tsx
   import React from 'react';
   import { SuccessToast } from './SuccessToast';
   import { ErrorToast } from './ErrorToast';

   interface ToastContainerProps {
     status: AddToChatStatus;
     errorMessage: string | null;
     onRetry: () => void;
   }

   export const ToastContainer: React.FC<ToastContainerProps> = ({
     status,
     errorMessage,
     onRetry,
   }) => {
     return (
       <div className="toast-container">
         {status === 'success' && <SuccessToast message="Document added to chat" />}
         {status === 'error' && (
           <ErrorToast message={errorMessage || 'Failed to add document to chat'} onRetry={onRetry} />
         )}
       </div>
     );
   };
   ```

   Update the `DocumentViewerModal` component to use the `ToastContainer` component:

   ```tsx
   return (
     <div>
       {/* ... other JSX */}
       <ToastContainer status={status} errorMessage={errorMessage} onRetry={handleAddToChat} />
     </div>
   );
   ```

### Performance Budget Alignment Summary

The changes made in this report should help improve the overall performance of the `DocumentViewerModal` component:

1. **Memory Leak Prevention**: Implementing the cleanup function in the `useEffect` hook will ensure that any event listeners or timers are properly removed when the component is unmounted, preventing potential memory leaks.

2. **Reduced Re-renders**: Memoizing the `DocumentViewerModal` component will prevent unnecessary re-renders when the props haven't changed, improving the overall rendering performance.

3. **Improved Toast Performance**: Extracting the toasts to a separate component will allow for better optimization and control over their rendering, potentially reducing the performance impact on the main `DocumentViewerModal` component.

These optimizations should help the `DocumentViewerModal` component stay within the performance budget and provide a smooth user experience, especially in scenarios where the component is rendered frequently or in high-traffic areas of the application.
